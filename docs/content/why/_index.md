## Why use this tool?


Imagine you make a practice of writing lots of software packages either
as an individual or as part of a team. Every time you have to create the
directory and file structure, you probably do this by hand. You probably
do it just a little differently each time, making small inconsistencies
on each project. Now imagine you also have to work on multiple software
packages and each one is set up a little differently, with slightly
different way of doing basic tasks like running unit tests. You would
spend at least some amount of resources : remembering the differences
between each project or fixing little mistakes between them.

The whole point of angreal is to allow you to forget how to set up a
project AND how to interact with it. By using templates for both project
structure AND administration, you don\'t have to remember how to do a
task - just that it can be done.

## How do I use them ?

You interact with an angreal in two steps :

1.  **Initialization** : Initializing an angreal means rendering a
    described template into a usable form. Templates can exist in one of
    three locations : local directories, remote git repositories, or
    pypi modules. Where an angreal template is distributed from is
    decided by whomever made that particular template.

```bash
# initialize and render the template angreal at the remote URI
$: angreal init https://gitlab.com/angreal/python3.git
# If you've used this template before you simply need to ...
$: angreal init python3
```

2.  **Execution** : Executing an angreal task through the `angreal`
    command line interface. This can only happen after the template has
    been rendered.

```bash
# From within an angreal based template
$: angreal <command to run>
```

## A Quick Example

Let\'s say you\'re starting a new software project and plan on using
[python 3](www.python.org). You also want to make sure that you\'re
following good practices and have documentation, testing, and type
hinting as part of the project.

You identify that the python3 angreal fits your needs well and choose to
use it.

1.  You initialize the project with :

```bash
$: angreal init python3
```

2.  You provide values for template variables with the interactive CLI :

```bash
source
name [package-name]: next_big_thing
author [joesmith]: Jane Smith
author_email [joesmit@email.com]: JaneSmith@email.com
```

3.  Angreal creates a project for you, using your provided variables to
    fill in some of the blanks.

```bash
.
├── LICENSE
├── MANIFEST.in
├── README.rst
├── conftest.py
├── docs
│   ├── Makefile
│   └── source
│       ├── _static
│       │   └── logo.png
│       ├── conf.py
│       └── index.rst
├── next_big_thing
│   ├── VERSION
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── cli.py
├── requirements
│   ├── dev.txt
│   └── requirements.txt
├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── fixtures.py
    ├── integration
    │   └── __init__.py
    └── unit
        └── __init__.py

8 directories, 17 files
```

4.  Next lets find out what tasks come with the template

```bash
$: cd next_big_thing
$: angreal list

Usage: angreal [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Project Commands:
  bump         bump the current package version
  docs         compile documentation for the project
  integration  run package tests
  setup        update/create the package_name environment.
  static       run static typing
  tests        run package tests

Global Commands:
  list  get a list of currently available commands
  init  Initialize an angreal based project.
```

5.  Now you do your thing and start developing on your software. At some
    point (hopefully early and often) you\'ll need to run unit tests.

```bash
$: angreal tests

cachedir: .pytest_cache
rootdir: /Users/dstorey/Desktop/next_big_thing, inifile:
plugins: cov-2.6.0
collected 0 items
Coverage.py warning: No data was collected. (no-data-collected)

------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                            5      5     0%
```

6.  Or maybe you need to compile the documentation you\'re writing as
    you go :

```bash
$: angreal docs

7.  Or maybe you just started developing on a new computer and want to
    make sure you\'re setup :

```bash
$: angreal setup

Virtual environment next_big_thing updated.
```
