-   [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

I got wind of cookie cutter about a year ago when i first started on
working on this problem. It\'s mature and largely solves the issue of
templating.

-   [click](http://click.pocoo.org/)

click is an absolutely fabulous tool for creating command line
interfaces in python programs. I\'ve known about it for a while - just
never really sat down with it. I wish I had earlier; it\'s intuitive
powerful and flexible.

-   [doit](http://pydoit.org/)

doit is a task management and automation tool. I used it as an
alternative to make for creating scientific work flows. I really like it
as both a program and a library. It\'s a great bit of software and
allows itself to be used within other peoples software, only down side
is writing doit tasks isn\'t necessarily intuitive.

Angreal uses portions of all of these tools to achieve its goals. It
would not exist without these tools so I\'d like to thank their
creators, maintainers, and contributors.
