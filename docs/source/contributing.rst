Angreal is hosted on `gitlab <https://gitlab.com/dylanbstorey/angreal>`_.

If you have questions, concerns, bug reports, or suggestions please feel free to open an
`issue <https://gitlab.com/dylanbstorey/angreal/issues/new>`_, I'll do my best to get it addressed at any time.


If you'd like to contribute back to angreal's code base (or documentation!) feel free to submit a
`merge request <https://gitlab.com/dylanbstorey/angreal/merge_requests/new>`_. Before submitting a merge request, it would
be best if you open a new issue that outlines what the problem you wish to solve is (and perhaps see if anyone else is working on it).
