- `cookiecutter`_

I got wind of cookie cutter about a year ago when i first started on working on this problem. It's mature and largely solves the issue
of templating.



- `click`_

click is an absolutely fabulous tool for creating command line interfaces in python programs. I've known about it
for a while - just never really sat down with it. I wish I had earlier; it's intuitive powerful and flexible.

- `doit`_

doit is a task management and automation tool. I used it as an alternative to make for creating scientific work flows. I really like it as both a program
and a library. It's a great bit of software and allows itself to be used within other peoples software, only down side is writing doit tasks
isn't necessarily intuitive.


Angreal uses portions of all of these tools to achieve its goals. It would not exist without
these tools so I'd like to thank their creators, maintainers, and contributors.
