.. admonition:: TL;DR

    **Angreal is meant to :**

    - allow the consistent creation of projects
    - provide consistent methods for interacting with projects


What is it?
============

Angreal is an attempt to solve two problems that i was running into in both my personal and professional life as a data
scientist and software developer. I do things often enough that they needed automation, I don't do things so often that I
remember all of the steps/commands I might need to get them done. Angreal solves this problem by allowing me to remember
by forgetting : I only have to remember the command to do something not the actual steps to complete the task.


How does it solve these challenges ?
=====================================

Angreal provides a way to template the structure of projects and a way of executing methods for interacting with that project in a 
consistent manner. These methods (called tasks) travel with the project so while templated intially, they're customizable to the 
project - allowing some level of flexibility in how a task functions between projects.
