# Workspace Structure Implementation Initiative

## Context

After removing raw Python dependencies, we need to restructure angreal as a Cargo workspace. This will establish the foundation for future crate additions (like the MCP server) while maintaining the current functionality in a more modular structure.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Convert the project to a Cargo workspace structure
- Create the initial workspace with one crate (angreal)
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Set up proper workspace configuration
- Prepare structure for future crate additions

**Non-Goals:**
- Adding additional crates beyond the initial one
- Implementing MCP server (future work)
- Changing public APIs or interfaces
- Refactoring internal module structure

## Detailed Design

1. **Workspace Setup**:
   - Create root `Cargo.toml` with workspace configuration
   - Move existing code into `crates/angreal/` subdirectory
   - Update all path references

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Update CI/CD pipelines for workspace structure
   - Ensure all build scripts work with new layout
   - Update documentation paths

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Configure workspace-level dependencies
   - Share common dependencies across future crates
   - Set up workspace-wide features

4. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Ensure tests run correctly in workspace
   - Set up workspace-wide test commands

## Alternatives Considered

- **Keep monolithic structure**: Would make future crate additions more difficult
- **Create multiple crates immediately**: Premature optimization, better to start simple
- **Use git submodules**: Adds unnecessary complexity for internal structure

## Implementation Plan

1. **Planning**: Define exact workspace structure and layout
2. **Migration**: Move existing code to new structure
3. **Configuration**: Set up workspace Cargo.toml and build configs
4. **Validation**: Ensure all functionality works as before
5. **Documentation**: Update READMEs and docs for new structure

## Testing Strategy

- All existing tests pass in new structure
- Binary builds and runs exactly as before
- CI/CD pipelines work without modification
- No breaking changes for end users
- Workspace commands (test, build, etc.) work correctly
