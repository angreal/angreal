# Documentation quality audit and style standardization

## Objective

Audit and revise all documentation in the angreal project to ensure alignment with the Diátaxis framework, factual accuracy against the current codebase, and a consistent prosaic writing style that favors full sentences and narrative flow over fragmented bullet lists.

## Technical Debt Impact

The current documentation has accumulated inconsistencies over time as features have been added and modified. Some pages rely heavily on bullet-point formatting which can obscure the relationship between concepts and make the documentation feel more like a reference card than a teaching resource. Additionally, as the codebase has evolved, some documentation may describe behavior that no longer matches the implementation.

Addressing this debt will improve the onboarding experience for new users, reduce support burden by providing clearer explanations, and establish a sustainable documentation standard that can be maintained as the project grows.

The risk of not addressing this is that documentation quality continues to degrade, users struggle to understand features, and the gap between documented and actual behavior widens with each release.

## Backlog Item Details

### Type

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

### Quality and Style
- [x] All documentation pages reviewed against Diátaxis framework and correctly categorized as tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, or reference material
- [x] Each page uses the appropriate Diátaxis structure for its category rather than mixing concerns
- [x] Prose style converted from bullet-heavy formatting to full sentences and paragraphs where appropriate
- [ ] All code examples verified to work with current angreal version (deferred - requires test harness)
- [x] API reference pages verified against actual function signatures and behavior
- [x] Inconsistencies between documentation and implementation identified and resolved
- [x] Style guide document created establishing prosaic writing standards for future contributions

### Missing Reference Documentation
- [x] Git integration reference documentation created covering PyGit class and git_clone function
- [ ] Docker image module reference documentation created (deferred - docker-pyo3 updates in progress)
- [ ] Docker container module reference documentation created (deferred - docker-pyo3 updates in progress)
- [ ] Docker network module reference documentation created (deferred - docker-pyo3 updates in progress)
- [ ] Docker volume module reference documentation created (deferred - docker-pyo3 updates in progress)
- [x] CLI init command documentation verified or created
- [x] CLI alias command documentation verified or created
- [x] CLI completion command documentation verified or created
- [x] CLI tree command documentation verified or created

### Missing Conceptual Documentation
- [x] Explanation of command and group decorator internals documented
- [x] Template system and Tera templating engine explained
- [x] Task discovery mechanism and .angreal directory structure documented
- [x] Distinction between project tasks and template tasks clarified

## Diátaxis Framework Reference

The Diátaxis framework organizes documentation into four distinct types, each serving a different user need. Tutorials are learning-oriented and guide newcomers through their first experience with the tool. How-to guides are task-oriented and show experienced users how to accomplish specific goals. Explanations are understanding-oriented and help users grasp concepts and architectural decisions. Reference material is information-oriented and provides precise technical specifications.

Each documentation page should belong to exactly one of these categories. A page that tries to be both a tutorial and a reference will serve neither purpose well. During the audit, pages that mix concerns should be split or restructured to align with a single Diátaxis category.

## Prosaic Style Guidelines

Documentation should read like well-written technical prose rather than a collection of bullet points. When describing a process, write it as a narrative that guides the reader through each step with context about why each action matters. When explaining a concept, develop the idea across connected sentences that build understanding progressively.

Bullet lists remain appropriate for genuinely list-like content such as enumerated options, parameter tables, or feature comparisons. However, explanatory text should not be fragmented into bullets simply to save space. A paragraph that explains how three components interact is more valuable than three bullet points that name those components without explaining their relationship.

Code examples should be preceded by prose that explains what the code demonstrates and followed by prose that highlights important details the reader should notice.

## Scope

The audit should cover all files in the `docs/content/` directory. Draft files in `docs/_draft/` are excluded from this audit but may inform decisions about what documentation is missing or incomplete.

## Missing Documentation

The following documentation gaps have been identified and should be addressed as part of this work.

### Reference Documentation Gaps

The Git integration module exposes a PyGit class with methods for clone, add, commit, push, pull, and checkout operations, along with a standalone git_clone function. No reference documentation currently exists for this integration despite it being a core part of the integrations offering.

The Docker integration documentation only covers Docker Compose. The codebase also exposes lower-level Docker modules for image management, container lifecycle, network operations, and volume management. These four modules are completely undocumented.

The CLI reference documentation may be incomplete. The init, alias, completion, and tree commands need verification that their documentation exists and accurately describes current behavior.

### Conceptual Documentation Gaps

No documentation explains how the command and group decorators work internally, which would help users understand the task registration system and debug issues when tasks are not discovered correctly.

The template system and Tera templating engine lack explanation documentation. Users creating templates would benefit from understanding how variable substitution and conditional logic work within angreal templates.

The task discovery mechanism and the significance of the .angreal directory structure is not documented. New users often struggle to understand why their tasks are or are not being discovered.

The distinction between tasks defined within a project versus tasks defined in templates is not clearly explained anywhere in the documentation.
